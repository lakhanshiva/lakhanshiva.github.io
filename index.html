  <p>Hi, This is Lakhan. I am a graduate from the University of Colorado, Boulder with an MS in Electrical Engineering. During my studies my work encompassed Embedded Software Development, Design of Algorithms. I studied formal methods that have applications to autonomous control and trustworthy systems. Particularly, I worked on studying and proving safety and temporal properties for a platooning protocol in autonomous vehicles for my master's thesis. Some of the classes I have taken are Design and Analsysis of Algorithms, Embedded System Design, High-Dimensional Datasets, Control Systems, Computer Aided Verification and Human-Robot Interaction. </p>
