  <p>I am a graduate student at University of Colorado, Boulder. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Fabio Somenzi. My primary research interests lie in Formal Methods, Hybrid Cyber-Physical Systems. I am interested in Cyber-Physical Systems that have applications to medical, automobile, and avionics domains. Particularly I'm working on performing reachability analysis to prove safety and temporal properties and establish functional correctness of such system and am interested in formal synthesis, where we transform the high-level specifications (expressed using some form of temporal logic) into autonomous control actions.</p>

   <p>Before coming to CUB, I graduated from BITS-Pilani, Hyderabad campus with a B.E in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I worked as a Google Summer of Code Firmware Intern in 2018. Prior to that, I was a Hardware Engineering intern at Google, California in 2017. I worked for a while as an Associate Developer at Deloitte Consulting's office in Bangalore.
    In the industry, I have experience of doing Functional Verification of Pre-Silicon chip designs- using Formal, Simulation techniques,
    ASIC Hardware design(RTL), Embedded System Firmware.
