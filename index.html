  <p>I am soon to graduate from the University of Colorado, Boulder with an MS in Electrical Engineering. During my studies my work encompassed Embedded Software Development, Design of Algorithms. I studied formal methods that have applications to autonomous control and trustworthy systems. Particularly, I worked on studying and proving safety and temporal properties for a platooning protocol in autonomous vehicles for my master's thesis. Some of the classes I have taken are Design and Analsysis of Algorithms, Embedded System Design, High-Dimensional Datasets, Control Systems, Computer Aided Verification and Human-Robot Interaction. </p>

   <p>Before coming to Boulder, I graduated from BITS-Pilani, Hyderabad campus with a B.E in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I worked as a Google Summer of Code Firmware Intern in 2018. Prior to that, I was a Hardware Engineering intern at Google, California in 2017. I worked for an year as an Associate Developer at Deloitte Consulting's office in Bangalore. </p>
    <p>In the industry, I have experience of designing and implementing Algorithms, Embedded System Firmware,Functional Verification of Pre-Silicon chip designs, developing software applications and services (RESTful), experience with SQL & NoSQL databases and Agile methodology. If you would like to get in touch, send me an email.
