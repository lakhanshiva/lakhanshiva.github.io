  <p>I am a graduate student at University of Colorado, Boulder. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Fabio Somenzi. My primary research interests lie in Formal Methods, Cyber-Physical Systems that have applications to automobiles. Particularly I'm working on proving safety and temporal properties and establish functional correctness of such systems. </p>

   <p>Before coming to CUB, I graduated from BITS-Pilani, Hyderabad campus with a B.E in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I worked as a Google Summer of Code Firmware Intern in 2018. Prior to that, I was a Hardware Engineering intern at Google, California in 2017. I worked for a while as an Associate Developer at Deloitte Consulting's office in Bangalore.
    In the industry, I have experience of doing Functional Verification of Pre-Silicon chip designs- using Formal, Simulation techniques,
    ASIC Hardware design(RTL), Embedded System Firmware.
