  <p>I am soon to graduate from the University of Colorado, Boulder with an MS in Electrical Engineering. During my studies my work encompassed Formal Methods, Cyber-Physical Systems that have applications to autonomous control and trustworthy systems. Particularly, I worked on studying and proving safety and temporal properties for a platooning protocol in autonomous vehicles for my master's thesis. Some of the classes I have taken are Design and Analsysis of Algorithms, Embedded System Design, High-Dimensional Datasets, Control Systems, Computer Aided Verification and Human-Robot Interaction. </p>

   <p>Before coming to CUB, I graduated from BITS-Pilani, Hyderabad campus with a B.E in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I worked as a Google Summer of Code Firmware Intern in 2018. Prior to that, I was a Hardware Engineering intern at Google, California in 2017. I worked for an year as an Associate Developer at Deloitte Consulting's office in Bangalore.
    In the industry, I have experience of implementing Algorithms, developing software applications and services, Functional Verification of Pre-Silicon chip designs- using Formal, Simulation techniques, ASIC Hardware design(RTL), Embedded System Firmware.
